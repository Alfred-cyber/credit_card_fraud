Credit Card Fraud Detection 


The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem involves building a model based on historical credit card transactions, specifically those that have been identified as fraudulent. The purpose of this system is to assess the legitimacy of new transactions and determine if they are fraudulent. Our objective is to achieve a high detection rate for fraudulent transactions, ideally identifying 100% of them, while simultaneously minimizing the occurrence of false positives or incorrect classifications of legitimate transactions as fraud. The goal is to strike a balance between sensitivity and specificity, ensuring accurate identification of fraud while avoiding unnecessary inconvenience to legitimate cardholders.
